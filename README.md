# Frequency-Aware Convex Enhancement (FaCE) (ICLR2026 submission)


![FaCE main figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iclr26/FaCE/main/figures/main_figure.jpg)

Overall pipeline of our proposed FaCE framework. FaCE innovatively leverages the MFT to perform data-driven spectral-domain clustering, effectively capturing joint amplitude and phase spectral characteristics. The derived enhancement curve robustly reconstructs enhanced images from low-light inputs in a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised manner, significantly improving interpretability and visual quality over existing frequency-domain methods.


### Emphasize 3 pointsÔºö
1ÔºâWe never optimize reflectance. We only adjust illumination (via luminance/log-luminance) and rebuild the image with unchanged chroma, which is equivalent to keeping ùëÖ fixed.

2ÔºâInput low-light I (not L)  --> (Eq.7 on I) estimate W  --> apply operator T to luminance/log-luminance (illumination only)
                      keep chroma (I / Y) unchanged --> replace luminance with the enhanced one --> output I_enh

3Ôºâ We use I=R‚ãÖL purely as a modeling convention. In practice, we derive an illumination proxy from the input (luminance/log-luminance), keep chroma unchanged (thereby treating reflectance as fixed), and apply a fixed frequency-domain operator only to the illumination proxy. Eq. (7) is evaluated on the observed low-light input to estimate spectral weights; this does not imply we modify reflectance or perform intrinsic decomposition.    


### How `I` links to `L` and `R` (what the code actually does)

We use `I = R * L` as a **modeling convention** to separate appearance into:
- **reflectance-like** (color ratios / chroma), and
- **illumination-like** (brightness).

In code we derive both **from the same input `I`**:

- **Illumination proxy.**  
  `Y = rgb_to_luminance(I)` ‚Üí `L_hat = log(eps + Y)` (or use `Y` directly).  
  This is the **only** branch we enhance.

- **Chroma (reflectance-like).**  
  `C = I / (Y + eps)` (element-wise).  
  We keep `C` **fixed** during reconstruction ‚Üí effectively **do not modify reflectance (`R`)**.

- **Reconstruction.**  
  After enhancing illumination only, write it back with chroma unchanged:  
  `I_enh = C * Y_enh` (or `C * exp(L_hat_enh)` if you work in log space).

> **Takeaway:** We never estimate or edit a stand-alone `R`. Chroma is preserved, so reflectance is operationally fixed; we only adjust illumination.

### What Eq.(7) is computed on (and why)

- **Eq.(7) is computed on the observed low-light input `I_low`.**  
  Purpose: estimate **data-driven spectral weights** `W(u,v)` **from the input you want to enhance**.

- Those weights parameterize a **fixed frequency-domain operator** `T`, which we then apply **only to the illumination proxy** (`L_hat`), not to chroma.

**Short version:**  
`Eq.(7) on I_low ‚Üí W ‚Üí apply T to L_hat only ‚Üí rebuild with fixed chroma ‚Üí I_enh`.

### Minimal code path (exact steps)

```python
# Input
# I: float tensor [H, W, 3] in [0,1]

# 1) From I ‚Üí illumination proxy (L_hat) and chroma (C)
Y     = rgb_to_luminance(I)                 # illumination-like
L_hat = torch.log(eps + Y)                  # illumination proxy (log luminance)
C     = I / (Y.unsqueeze(-1) + eps)         # reflectance-like (kept fixed)

# 2) Eq.(7) on the observed low-light input I ‚Üí spectral weights W(u,v)
W_alpha = build_W_from_I(I, a=a1, b=b1)     # MR = log1p(|FFT(Y)|) ‚Üí mean-center ‚Üí sigmoid
W_beta  = build_W_from_I(I, a=a2, b=b2)
LP      = gaussian_lowpass_like(W_alpha, sigma_frac=lp_sigma_frac)

# 3) Fixed frequency-domain operator T, applied ONLY to illumination (L_hat)
def T(X, W):
    F  = torch.fft.rfft2(X, norm="ortho")
    FX = F * W * LP                          # element-wise in frequency domain
    return torch.fft.irfft2(FX, s=None, norm="ortho")

L_enh_a = T(L_hat, W_alpha)
L_enh_b = T(L_hat, W_beta)

# 4) Write illumination back with chroma fixed (reflectance unchanged)
Y_enh_a = torch.exp(L_enh_a)                 # if you worked in log space
Y_enh_b = torch.exp(L_enh_b)
I_a     = C * Y_enh_a.unsqueeze(-1)          # chroma preserved
I_b     = C * Y_enh_b.unsqueeze(-1)

# 5) (Optional) choose a mix between two strengths
I_enh = I_a  # or small search over alpha in [0,1]: I_enh = alpha*I_a + (1-alpha)*I_b

- No training: only (Œ±, Œ≤) optimized by convex objective (LBFGS / closed-form fallback).

## ‚ÄúMisdiagnosis‚Äù clarification
Some readers may initially interpret our approach as a learnable network that alters reflectance. It is not. FaCE computes spectral weights from the observed image and applies a fixed frequency-domain operator to illumination only (via luminance/log-luminance). Reflectance is kept unchanged by preserving chroma during reconstruction. R is fixed; only L is optimized; clustering runs on MR=log(1+|M|) (Riesz). We surface debug maps and code-to-equation mapping to avoid confusion.
